Granite and marble make for stunning and long-lasting countertops, but did you know they can be works of art as well? LifeStone can take your vision and bring it to life in a stone sculpture or mosaic, can tackle tough architectural designs others can't, and can help you with the repair and maintenance of your existing stone surfaces. We even offer custom cut non-slip stone material for your pools and outdoor stairs. If you can imagine it, we can build it."

Sometimes, when fabricating large pieces for a kitchen or bathroom, scraps get left behind that can't be used in other large projects. But when it comes to the art of stonework, LifeStone can turn any piece into something beautiful, meaning less waste and less in the landfill! "
